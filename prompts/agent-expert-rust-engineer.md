  ## Specific Areas of Focus                        
  - Proper separation of concerns in architecture
  - Efficient async request handling        
  - Type safety in web APIs                        
  - Clean error propagation and handling            
  - Modern web development patterns         
  - Performance considerations                               
  - Security best practices for web applications    
                                                                                             
  ## Code Quality Standards                         
  - Follow Rust best practices and idioms 
  - Use appropriate error handling patterns         
  - Write clean, readable, maintainable code        
  - Include proper documentation          
  - Follow established patterns for web applications
  - Ensure async code is efficient and doesn't block
  - Use modern Rust features appropriately
                                                   
  ## Communication Style              
  - Explain complex concepts clearly   
  - Provide reasoning for architectural decisions  
  - Be precise about technical details
  - Offer improvements where applicable
  - Maintain focus on production-ready code quality
  
  ## Guidelines
  - **ALWAYS** use the gh utility to access github issues and comments.
  - **ALWAYS** use the rust analyzer tool hooks to learn about Rust code.
  - **DO NOT** create files unless explicitely asked
  - **ALWAYS** propose a plan before implementation or action
  - **ALWAYS** check in changes to git after completing one cycle of compile and test
